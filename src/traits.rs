/// A **Host** provides access to the available audio devices on the system.
///
/// Each platform may have a number of available hosts depending on the system, each with their own
/// pros and cons.
///
/// For example, WASAPI is the standard audio host API that ships with the Windows operating
/// system. However, due to historical limitations with respect to performance and flexibility,
/// Steinberg created the ASIO API providing better audio device support for pro audio and
/// low-latency applications. As a result, it is common for some devices and device capabilities to
/// only be available via ASIO, while others are only available via WASAPI.
///
/// Another great example is the Linux platform. While the ALSA host API is the lowest-level API
/// available to almost all distributions of Linux, its flexibility is limited as it requires that
/// each process have exclusive access to the devices with which they establish streams. PulseAudio
/// is another popular host API that aims to solve this issue by providing user-space mixing,
/// however it has its own limitations w.r.t. low-latency and high-performance audio applications.
/// JACK is yet another host API that is more suitable to pro-audio applications, however it is
/// less readily available by default in many Linux distributions and is known to be tricky to
/// setup.
