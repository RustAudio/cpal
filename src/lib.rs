# How to use cpal

In order to play a sound, first you need to create a `Voice`.

```no_run
// getting the default sound output of the system (can return `None` if nothing is supported)
let endpoint = cpal::get_default_endpoint().unwrap();

// note that the user can at any moment disconnect the device, therefore all operations return
// a `Result` to handle this situation

// getting a format for the PCM
let format = endpoint.get_supported_formats_list().unwrap().next().unwrap();

let mut voice = cpal::Voice::new(&endpoint, &format).unwrap();
```

Then you must send raw samples to it by calling `append_data`. You must take the number of channels
and samples rate into account when writing the data.

TODO: add example

**Important**: the `append_data` function can return a buffer shorter than what you requested.
This is the case if the device doesn't have enough space available. **It happens very often**,
this is not some obscure situation that can be ignored.

After you have submitted data for the first time, call `play`:

```no_run
# let mut voice: cpal::Voice = unsafe { std::mem::uninitialized() };
voice.play();
```

The audio device of the user will read the buffer that you sent, and play it. If the audio device
reaches the end of the data, it will stop playing. You must continuously fill the buffer by
calling `append_data` repeatedly if you don't want the audio to stop playing.
