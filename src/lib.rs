//! # How to use cpal
//!
//! Here are some concepts cpal exposes:
//!
//! - An endpoint is a target where the data of the audio channel will be played.
//! - A voice is an open audio channel which you can stream audio data to. You have to choose which
//!   endpoint your voice targets before you create one.
//! - An event loop is a collection of voices. Each voice must belong to an event loop, and all the
//!   voices that belong to an event loop are managed together.
//!
//! In order to play a sound, you first need to create an event loop:
//!
//! ```
//! use cpal::EventLoop;
//! let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
//! ```
//!
//! Then choose an endpoint. You can either use the default endpoint with the `default_endpoint()`
//! function, or enumerate all the available endpoints with the `endpoints()` function. Beware that
//! `default_endpoint()` returns an `Option` in case no endpoint is available on the system.
//!
//! ```
//! // Note: we call `unwrap()` because it is convenient, but you should avoid doing that in a real
//! // code.
//! let endpoint = cpal::default_endpoint().expect("no endpoint is available");
//! ```
//!
//! Before we can create a voice, we must decide what the format of the audio samples is going to
//! be. You can query all the supported formats with the `supported_formats()` method, which
//! produces a list of `SupportedFormat` structs which can later be turned into actual `Format`
//! structs. If you don't want to query the list of formats, you can also build your own `Format`
//! manually, but doing so could lead to an error when building the voice if the format ends up not
//! being supported.
//!
//! > **Note**: the `supported_formats()` method could return an error for example if the device
//! > has been disconnected.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let endpoint = cpal::default_endpoint().unwrap();
//! let mut supported_formats_range = endpoint.supported_formats()
//!                                           .expect("error while querying formats");
//! let format = supported_formats_range.next().expect("no supported format?!")
//!                                     .with_max_samples_rate();
//! ```
//!
//! Now that we have everything, we can create a voice from that event loop:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let endpoint = cpal::default_endpoint().unwrap();
//! # let format = endpoint.supported_formats().unwrap().next().unwrap().with_max_samples_rate();
//! # let event_loop = cpal::EventLoop::new();
//! let voice_id = event_loop.build_voice(&endpoint, &format).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! The value returned by `build_voice()` is of type `VoiceId` and is an identifier that will
//! allow you to control the voice.
//!
//! There is a last step to perform before going forward, which is to start the voice. This is done
//! with the `play()` method on the event loop.
//!
//! ```
//! # let event_loop: cpal::EventLoop = return;
//! # let voice_id: cpal::VoiceId = return;
//! event_loop.play(voice_id);
//! ```
//!
//! Once everything is done, you must call `run()` on the `event_loop`.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let event_loop = cpal::EventLoop::new();
//! event_loop.run(move |_voice_id, _buffer| {
//!     // write data to `buffer` here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! > **Note**: Calling `run()` will block the thread forever, so it's usually best done in a
//! > separate thread.
//!
//! While `run()` is running, the audio device of the user will from time to time call the callback
//! that you passed to this function. The callback gets passed the voice ID, and a struct of type
//! `UnknownTypeBuffer` that represents the buffer that must be filled with audio samples. The
//! `UnknownTypeBuffer` can be one of `I16`, `U16` or `F32` depending on the format that was passed
//! to `build_voice`.
//!
//! In this example, we simply simply fill the buffer with zeroes.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cpal::UnknownTypeBuffer;
//!
//! # let event_loop = cpal::EventLoop::new();
//! event_loop.run(move |_voice_id, mut buffer| {
//!     match buffer {
//!         UnknownTypeBuffer::U16(mut buffer) => {
//!             for elem in buffer.iter_mut() {
//!                 *elem = u16::max_value() / 2;
//!             }
//!         },
//!         UnknownTypeBuffer::I16(mut buffer) => {
//!             for elem in buffer.iter_mut() {
//!                 *elem = 0;
//!             }
//!         },
//!         UnknownTypeBuffer::F32(mut buffer) => {
//!             for elem in buffer.iter_mut() {
//!                 *elem = 0.0;
//!             }
//!         },
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
