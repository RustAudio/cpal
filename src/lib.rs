# How to use cpal

In order to play a sound, first you need to create a `Voice`.

```no_run
let mut voice = cpal::Voice::new();
```

Then you must send raw samples to it by calling `append_data`.
This function takes three parameters: the number of channels, the number of samples
that must be played per second, and the number of samples that you have available.

You can then fill the buffer with the data.

```no_run
# let mut voice = cpal::Voice::new();
let mut buffer: cpal::Buffer<f32> = voice.append_data(2, cpal::SamplesRate(44100), 1024);

// filling the buffer with 0s
for e in buffer.iter_mut() {
    *e = 0.0f32;
}
```

**Important**: the `append_data` function can return a buffer shorter than what you requested.
This is the case if the device doesn't have enough space available. **It happens very often**,
this is not some obscure situation that can be ignored.

After you have submitted data for the first time, call `play`:

```no_run
# let mut voice = cpal::Voice::new();
voice.play();
```

The audio device of the user will read the buffer that you sent, and play it. If the audio device
reaches the end of the data, it will stop playing. You must continuously fill the buffer by
calling `append_data` repeatedly if you don't want the audio to stop playing.

# Native format

Each `Voice` is bound to a specific number of channels, samples rate, and samples format.
If you call `append_data` with values different than these, then cpal will automatically perform
a conversion on your data.

If you have the possibility, you should try to match the format of the voice.
