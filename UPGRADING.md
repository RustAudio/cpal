# Upgrading from v0.16 to v0.17

This guide covers breaking changes requiring code updates. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list of changes and improvements.

## Breaking Changes Checklist

- [ ] Replace `SampleRate(n)` with plain `n` values
- [ ] Update `windows` crate to >= 0.59, <= 0.62 (Windows only)
- [ ] Update `alsa` crate to 0.10 (Linux only)
- [ ] Remove `wee_alloc` feature from Wasm builds (if used)
- [ ] Wrap CoreAudio streams in `Arc` if you were cloning them (macOS only)
- [ ] Handle `BuildStreamError::StreamConfigNotSupported` for `BufferSize::Fixed` (JACK, strict validation)
- [ ] Update device name matching if using ALSA (Linux only)

**Recommended migrations:**
- [ ] Replace deprecated `device.name()` calls with `device.description()` or `device.id()`

---

## 1. SampleRate is now a u32 type alias

**What changed:** `SampleRate` changed from a struct to a `u32` type alias.

```rust
// Before (v0.16)
use cpal::SampleRate;
let config = StreamConfig {
    channels: 2,
    sample_rate: SampleRate(44100),
    buffer_size: BufferSize::Default,
};

// After (v0.17)
let config = StreamConfig {
    channels: 2,
    sample_rate: 44100,
    buffer_size: BufferSize::Default,
};
```

**Impact:** Remove `SampleRate()` constructor calls. The type is now just `u32`, so use integer literals or variables directly.

---

## 2. Device::name() deprecated (soft deprecation)

**What changed:** `Device::name()` is deprecated in favor of `id()` and `description()`.

```rust
// Old (still works but shows deprecation warning)
let name = device.name()?;

// New: For user-facing display
let desc = device.description()?;
println!("Device: {}", desc);  // or desc.name() for just the name

// New: For stable identification and persistence
let id = device.id()?;
let id_string = id.to_string();  // Save this
// Later...
let device = host.device_by_id(&id_string.parse()?)?;
```

**Impact:** Deprecation warnings only. The old API still works in v0.17. Update when convenient to prepare for future versions.

**Why:** Separates stable device identification (`id()`) from human-readable names (`description()`).

---

## 3. CoreAudio Stream no longer Clone (macOS)

**What changed:** On macOS, `Stream` no longer implements `Clone`. Use `Arc` instead.

```rust
// Before (v0.16) - macOS only
let stream = device.build_output_stream(&config, data_fn, err_fn, None)?;
let stream_clone = stream.clone();

// After (v0.17) - all platforms
let stream = Arc::new(device.build_output_stream(&config, data_fn, err_fn, None)?);
let stream_clone = Arc::clone(&stream);
```

**Why:** Removed as part of making `Stream` implement `Send` on macOS.

---

## 4. BufferSize behavior changes

### BufferSize::Default now uses host defaults

**What changed:** `BufferSize::Default` now defers to the audio host/device defaults instead of applying cpal's opinionated defaults.

**Impact:** Buffer sizes may differ from v0.16, affecting latency characteristics:
- **Lower latency** in most cases (hosts typically choose sensible defaults)
- **May underrun** on resource-constrained systems previously relying on larger cpal defaults
- **Better integration** with system audio configuration (e.g., PulseAudio, PipeWire, JACK)

**Migration:** If you experience underruns or need specific latency, use `BufferSize::Fixed(size)` instead of relying on defaults.

**Platform-specific notes:**
- **ALSA:** Previously used cpal's hardcoded 25ms periods / 100ms buffer, now uses device defaults
- **All platforms:** Default buffer sizes now match what the host audio system expects

### BufferSize::Fixed validation stricter

**What changed:** Several backends now reject invalid `BufferSize::Fixed` requests instead of silently adjusting:

- **ALSA:** Validates against hardware constraints (was: rounded to nearest)
- **JACK:** Must exactly match server buffer size (was: silently ignored)
- **Emscripten/WebAudio:** Validates min/max range
- **ASIO:** Stricter lower bound validation

```rust
// Handle validation errors
let mut config = StreamConfig {
    channels: 2,
    sample_rate: 44100,
    buffer_size: BufferSize::Fixed(512),
};

match device.build_output_stream(&config, data_fn, err_fn, None) {
    Ok(stream) => { /* success */ },
    Err(BuildStreamError::StreamConfigNotSupported) => {
        config.buffer_size = BufferSize::Default;  // Fallback
        device.build_output_stream(&config, data_fn, err_fn, None)?
    },
    Err(e) => return Err(e),
}
```

**JACK users:** Use `BufferSize::Default` to automatically match the server's configured size.

---

## 5. Dependency updates

Update these dependencies if you use them directly:

```rust
[dependencies]
cpal = "0.17"

# Platform-specific (if used directly):
alsa = "0.10"  # Linux only
windows = { version = ">=0.58, <=0.62" }  # Windows only
audio_thread_priority = "0.34"  # All platforms
```

---

## 6. ALSA device enumeration changed (Linux)

**What changed:** Device enumeration now returns all devices from `aplay -L`. v0.16 had a regression that only returned card names, missing all device variants.

```rust
# v0.16: Only card names ("Loopback", "HDA Intel PCH")
# v0.17: All aplay -L devices (default, hw:CARD=X,DEV=Y, plughw:, front:, surround51:, etc.)
```

**Impact:** Many more devices will be enumerated. Device names/IDs will be much more detailed. Update any code that matches specific ALSA device names.

---

## 7. Wasm wee_alloc feature removed

**What changed:** The optional `wee_alloc` feature was removed for security reasons.

```rust
# Before (v0.16)
cpal = { version = "0.16", features = ["wasm-bindgen", "wee_alloc"] }

# After (v0.17)
cpal = { version = "0.17", features = ["wasm-bindgen"] }
```

---

## Notable Non-Breaking Improvements

v0.17 also includes significant improvements that don't require code changes:

- **Stable device IDs:** New `device.id()` returns persistent device identifiers that survive reboots/reconnections. Use `host.device_by_id()` to reliably select saved devices.
- **Streams are Send+Sync everywhere:** All platforms now support moving/sharing streams across threads
- **24-bit sample formats:** Added `I24`/`U24` support on ALSA, CoreAudio, WASAPI, ASIO
- **Custom host support:** Implement your own `Host`/`Device`/`Stream` for proprietary platforms
- **WebAudio AudioWorklet:** Lower latency web audio backend when Wasm atomics are enabled
- **Predictable buffer sizes:** CoreAudio and AAudio now ensure consistent callback buffer sizes
- **Expanded sample rate support:** ALSA supports 12, 24, 352.8, 384, 705.6, and 768 kHz
- **WASAPI advanced interop:** Exposed `IMMDevice` for Windows COM interop scenarios
- **Platform improvements:** macOS loopback recording (14.6+), better ALSA performance, improved timestamp accuracy, iOS AVAudioSession integration, JACK on all platforms
